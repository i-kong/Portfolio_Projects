# IT Expenses Dashboard

In this project, IT expense csv files were imported to Power BI and 3 pages of dashboards were created.
The first page was an overview of budgeted numbers compared to actual and forecasted numbers, with the option to refine charts by regions.
The second page focused on budgets compared to forecasts by region, showing actual numbers and clearly visualizing amounts relative to each other.
The third page shows an allocation tree, which drills down on select variables to illustrate where amounts from from. 
This tree visualizes forecasted amounts exceed budgeted amounts, and we can see approximately half of the total difference comes from USA.
